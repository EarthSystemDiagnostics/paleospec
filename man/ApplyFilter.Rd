The endpoint constraint methods are based on the study:\cr

\usage{
ApplyFilter(data, filter, method = 0, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{numeric vector with the input timeseries (standard or ts object).}

\item{filter}{numeric vector of filter weights.}

\item{method}{single integer for choosing an endpoint constraint method;
available choices are integers 0-4, see details.}

\item{na.rm}{logical; control the handling of internal NA values in
\code{data}. If set to \code{TRUE}, any internal NA values are removed by
linear interpolation from the neighbouring values; defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a ts object with the filtered timeseries.
}
\description{
Apply a given filter to a time series using different endpoint constraints.
}
\details{
Note that when passing objects of class \code{ts}, the time step provided is
not used; thus, for time series with a time step different from 1, the filter
has to be adapted accordingly.

Leading and trailing NA values are automatically stripped from the input
vector so that they do not spread into the filtered data when applying the
endpoint constraints, but added in again after filtering so that the output
vector has the same length as the input. This does not apply to any internal
NA values, which instead are handled by \code{na.rm}.

The function applies endpoint constrains following Mann et al., GRL, 2004;
available methods are:
\itemize{
  \item method = 0: no constraint (loss at both ends);
  \item method = 1: minimum norm constraint;
  \item method = 2: minimum slope constraint;
  \item method = 3: minimum roughness constraint;
  \item method = 4: circular filtering.
}
}
\examples{
# Simple running mean filter across three bins

x <- 1 : 10
filter <- rep(1 / 3, 3)

# no endpoint constraints lead to loss at both ends
ApplyFilter(x, filter, method = 0)

# circular filtering avoids end losses, so as the other methods
ApplyFilter(x, filter, method = 4)

# leading and trailing NA's are ignored but added in again afterwards
x <- c(NA, 1 : 10, NA)
ApplyFilter(x, filter, method = 4)

# ... but not internal NA's
x <- c(1 : 5, NA, 7 : 10)
ApplyFilter(x, filter, method = 4)

# if not explicitly removed by linear interpolation
ApplyFilter(x, filter, method = 4, na.rm = TRUE)
